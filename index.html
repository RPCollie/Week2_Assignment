  <p style ="text-align:center;"> I am Ricardo Collie from Columbus, Mississippi. As shown above, I am an alumni of Mississippi State University.  Ater college, 
   in 2013, I decided to join the miliatry. Ater training in Texas, I PCS'd to Colorado Springs, CO. In 2014 and 2017 I deployed to Kuwait and Saudia Arabia.

   (Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station). In 2018, I decided to enroll into the computer programming technology program at Southwestern College.  I will be graduating
